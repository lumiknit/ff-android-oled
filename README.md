- [Iceraven-OLED](https://github.com/GoodyOG/Iceraven-OLED)

- (0002) Move new tab button in tab bottom sheet to center.

## Why Firefox, not Ironfox / Iceraven?

While Ironfox and Iceraven are indeed excellent projects,
I believe that due to their nature of being maintained on a smaller scale,
there may be delays in updates or potential compatibility issues.
Therefore, I thought it would be necessary to apply patches directly to the original browser app,
and I proceeded with that approach.

This might be usefule for those who want to use the original Firefox app with a little tweaking.
